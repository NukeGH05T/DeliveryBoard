DeliveryBoard generates delivery quests procedurally after timed intervals without any input from server admins. It has permission based delivery quests that makes it possible for you to create donor only delivery quests. The user friendly and intuitive GUI allows players to get started without any tutorials. All of that with custom items support from your favourite plugins.
